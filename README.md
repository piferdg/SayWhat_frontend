### App Description
The ‘SayWhat?’ app will allow the traveler to translate any words, sentences that they want. The traveler will be able to enter what they need translated in their native language, select a ‘target’ language that they’d like their sentence translated to, then click a button and have their sentence translated. ‘SayWhat?’ will also the traveler to add countries they'd like to visit. Including the ability to create/update/delete currency type, primary language, wikipedia page, and top 3 attractions.

### Problem Statement
Traveling is great, and can even be a life changing experience, but it can also be daunting if you’re unable to communicate. Many people are intimidated by traveling to foreign locations due to the language barrier. 

### How does "SayWhat?" solve this problem?
The SayWhat?’ app solves the communication problem and makes travel much more enjoyable. The traveler can type in whatever they need translated real time, or they can even study customized phrases and sentences prior to their trip. Additionally, by including extras like the ability to save a destination along with that destinations currency, primary language, and sites to visit, the traveler is removed of yet another burden while traveling.
